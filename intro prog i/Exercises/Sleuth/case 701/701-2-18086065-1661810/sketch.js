Case 701 - Recognisable robber - stage 3

Kid youâ€™re becoming a victim of your own success.
I just had a call from DI Max down at the precinct. He specifically requested your services.
They finally have a reliable witness for a robber who has been causing mayhem for some months.
Luckily they have a witness statement from hang daviswood. You know what to do kid.

Please create a function that takes a suspect object as parameter from the data structure below.
Your function should return a number value indicating how many of their properties match the witness statement.
You should use conditional statements to compare the suspect's properties to the statement.

The function is already being called in draw() but it is your job to implement it.

There are many possible ways of carrying out your duties,
but you should complete this task using ONLY the following
commands:

 - function matchProperties(suspectObj){}
 - if()

Witness statement:

I remember walking down the street and then I saw them. It's hard to say. They were fairly tall, I think between a height of 160 and 190 cm. Their expression seemed sad. I distinctly remember that they were wearing a purple hat, I remember thinking that was quite unusual. They were carrying a brown paper bag. It was very dark and I could barely see, They had ginger hair. They seemed to be between the age of 28 and 50 years old. They brobably weigh between 64 and 100 kg. I'll never forget their brown eyes. I hope I never have to go through that again.
